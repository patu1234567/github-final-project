## Introduction

The Face Mask Detection Project is a Python-based computer vision project designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using image processing techniques and machine learning. With the ongoing global pandemic, the use of face masks has become crucial for public health. This project aims to provide a solution for automated face mask detection in various settings, such as public places, offices, and healthcare facilities.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection:** The project can process real-time video streams from webcams, making it suitable for applications like monitoring mask compliance at entrances or security checkpoints.

- **Accuracy:** The face mask detection model is trained on a large dataset and offers high accuracy in distinguishing between masked and unmasked faces.

- **Alerts:** When an individual is detected without a mask in restricted areas, the system can generate alerts, notifications, or alarms, depending on the implementation.

- **Customizable:** The project is open-source and highly customizable, allowing you to adapt it to your specific requirements and integrate it into your applications.

## How it Works

The face mask detection project employs the following steps:

1. **Face Detection:** It uses a pre-trained face detection model to locate faces within an image or video frame.

2. **Mask Classification:** A deep learning model classifies each detected face as either "with mask" or "without mask."

3. **Alert Generation:** If an unmasked face is detected in a restricted area, an alert or notification is triggered.

## Getting Started

To use the Face Mask Detection Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
python mask_detection.py
